# The process for choosing a good name for project (StudySpace)

We chose the name StudySpace for our open source project because it
reflects our goal of helping students find the best study resources and tools
available, just like how in the vast space of our universe every molecule is binded together and welcomed with as much possibilities as possible. The name suggests that our project is a tool for locating and
identifying study resources in a private enviroment, like a planet drifting in its own world in the solar system.
We also wanted a name that was memorable and easy to say, and that
conveyed a sense of fun and excitement. We believe that StudySpace is the
perfect name for our project, with its motto of 'Reserve your own place, with plenty of space' and will help us to attract users and contributors who share our passion for learning and education.
