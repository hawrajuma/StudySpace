# The process for choosing a good name for project (StudySpace)

We chose the name StudySpace for our open source project because it
reflects our goal of helping students find the best study resources and tools
available. The name suggests that our project is a tool for locating and
identifying study resources, like a spotter in a gym who helps you to find and
use equipment effectively.
We also wanted a name that was memorable and easy to say, and that
conveyed a sense of fun and excitement. We believe that StudySpotter is the
perfect name for our project and will help us to attract users and contributors
who share our passion for learning and education.
