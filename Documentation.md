# Documentation
Although we are new to open source projects, we publish documentation to inform others about what is expected of them. Because our documentation is incomplete, a moderator will be responsible for updating it. In the documentation, we imply that even if we are not complete, we are going to skip part of what we did in order to offer a summary of what we did as well as a clue at what the expert performs and what will be approved.
