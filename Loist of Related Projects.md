# List all project and their links
Before starting our open-source project, we searched for similar
projects to our idea so we can get a glimpse of how our project will
manifest on the internet. The websites that we have found are not
open-source thus, our project which is a website that we built from
scratch as a free and open-source project and we will only take some
ideas from these projects.

1. Study Together: 24/7 Study Room & Focus Room
2. Studyverse | Virtual Study Rooms

The project that is used has been created for a web development
course and we have come to the conclusion that it would be a great
idea if we developed a free and open-source version of our website so
students from all over the world can benefit from it.
