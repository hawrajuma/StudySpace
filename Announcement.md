To reach the greatest number of students possible, we decided to use the social media platforms such as Instagram, twitter, and even TikTok under the name @studyspace as itâ€™s really important to unify our account name in all social media platform so the people can recognize our account and always remember it if they ever need a website for group studying and thus our goal of reaching to a lot of students is achieved.
