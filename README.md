Before starting our open-source project, we searched for similar projects to our idea so we can get a glimpse of how our project will manifest on the internet. The websites that we have found are not open-source thus, our project which is a website that we built from scratch as a free and open-source project and we will only take some ideas from these projects. 

## Starting from What You Have
The goal of this website is to offer the student a space where they can focus on their studies, since studying with other people will give the impression of being in classroom and thus, the students will feel as if they will be held accountable if they slacked in their studies, also it can act as a social platform where students can meet and talk about their school experience and give some of their knowledge and expertise.
