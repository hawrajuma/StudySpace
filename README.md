 The system that we will develop is an open source and free system, I mean that users can download it completely with the code.
* The system is an online booking tool that aids students in finding a comfortable location to do their schoolwork.
* Users can visit the website and make reservations there.

## The Project is Free and OpenSource
* a robust and user-friendly open-source booking study room software  and management system
> Note: This program was created as free open-source software under the provisions of the GNU License. All developers that wants to be part of the team are welcome to take part.

## Project limitation
1. The system will be written using the following programming languages (HTML,CSS,PHP,MYSQL,JS).
2. Users, site administrators, and developers will have access to the website.
3. Two months from the commencement date, the project will be finished.

## But first look around 
Before starting our open-source project, we searched for similar projects to our idea so we can get a glimpse of how our project will manifest on the internet. The websites that we have found are not open-source thus, our project which is a website that we built from scratch as a free and open-source project and we will only take some ideas from these projects. 

## Starting from What You Have
The goal of this website is to offer the student a space where they can focus on their studies, since studying with other people will give the impression of being in classroom and thus, the students will feel as if they will be held accountable if they slacked in their studies, also it can act as a social platform where students can meet and talk about their school experience and give some of their knowledge and expertise.

## Technology Used
* PHP programming language
* MySQL Relational Database
* HTML
* CSS3
* JS(JavaScript)

## Overall Project Summary
A user-friendly and intelligent study room booking experience is what the initiative seeks to provide for its users. In order to make the project as clever and straightforward as possible, we are aiming to incorporate a number of features.

## Mission Statement
Programmers can utilize the open-source application StudySpotter to create a flowless booking management system for scheduling study spaces that will aid students in their academic endeavors. Having users to have an easy-going access browse for available study rooms in the management system's room reservation feature and reserve them for certain days and hours that work with their schedules.

>  If you wanted a fast summary of the software, we would offer you this list of the features and prerequisites. 
### Features 
- Account creation and login should be possible for users so they may manage their bookings.
- Room availability having the system ought to let users know which study roomsare open at various times of the day.

## Version Control & Bug Tracker Acccess
We plan to use Git for version control and GitHub for bug tracking. We will access these systems through our GitHub repository, where we will keep track of changes made to the codebase and maintain a record of previous versions. To ensure best practices for version control, we will create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, commit frequently with meaningful commit messages, and merge changes back into the main branch once they have been reviewed and tested. This will allow us to easily revert changes if necessary and maintain a clean and organized codebase. For bug tracking, we will use GitHub's built-in issue tracking system. When an issue is reported, we will clearly describe the issue and provide steps to reproduce it. We will then assign the issue to the appropriate team member for resolution and prioritize it based on its severity and impact on the project. Once the issue has been resolved, we will close the issue and include a description of the fix. By following these best practices, we hope to ensure the success and longevity of our open source project. We will maintain a transparent and organized development process, allowing our community of contributors to easily contribute to and improve our project. We are committed to ensuring that our project is up-to-date, relevant, and bug-free for our users. Overall, we believe that our approach to version control and bug tracking will help us maintain a high level of quality for our open source project. By keeping our codebase organized and our development process transparent, we hope to attract more contributors and provide a better experience for our users. We will continue to refine our processes and practices over time to ensure the success and longevity of our project.

## Developer Guidlines
### Coding Guidelines for Developers
### The software developers that build the system or contribute to it can benefit from the guidance provided in this on-going publication. The suggestions address:
* Documentation and coding standards 
* Links to norms of behavior 
* How tasks are finally performed and how developers communicate with consumers and one another

### Every factor we have identified here enables the technical team to work with the executive team to make choices and steer the process toward success. 
* Although there is no expectation that you will remember anything, you should read the full manual at least once if you only sometimes create code or are not a part of the StudySpace system engineers' team.
* You should read these instructions if you are a member of the StudySpace system development team.

### Developers’ Interaction
* The rules and documents of the community must be followed by all members. Developers should communicate with one another using email, Whatssapp groupchat or Microsoft Teams.

> These are not rigid regulations, but rather *guidelines*. They would, in our opinion, serve to enhance cooperation, streamline our workflow, and benefit both the "products" that we make as developers as well as ourselves personally. The StudySpace system developers would be delighted to answer any questions you may have about the contents of this document.

### Goal of the Developer Guidelines:
* These rules are meant to make everything we create better so that we can proudly claim, "I was a part of that!" We shouldn't let up too much in our efforts to adhere to these rules. If you think they are taking too long, we need to review them. These facts can be altered.

### Code Format
* There should only be one code command per line.
* A two-line margin should be used to separate each code block from its neighbors.
* Control Flow 
* Guard Clause with indents
* Simple Parameter for Enumeration

### Code Scope
* Global variables DO NOT change them they are defualt 
* classes with just default constructor values should have default constructors.
* Name classes with their main functionality 
* Methods should be stored in MethodClass
* Everything in the code, including variables, should have names that are understandable and appropriate for their purposes (NO !@$^&%) allowed ).

### Which programming language should I use?
* There are no precise requirements for the programming languages that should be used to create StudySpace software. However, keep in mind that any software you produce will need to be maintained by you and your coworkers (both present and future). However, we now use HTML, CSS,  JQuery, and Javascript , we welcome any improvements that would enhance our project.

### Code comments
* wehn starting to issue a note of a code or an update write the right parameters that will help other developers to understand your point of view and changes.

### Readability
* Try to interact on usual basis to understand what is happening
* Do not try to fit as much code as you can into as few lines.
* avoid long lines of codes (MAX: 100 CHAR PER LINE)

### Issue Tracker 
* It accepts newly reported software issues and, when it is fixed, it is labeled as complete.

### Feature requests
* We are open to suggestions for new features. Before submitting a feature proposal, please take a time to make sure your concept matches with the project's objectives and scope. It is your responsibility to persuade the project maintainers to approve the feature. Please be as specific and contextual as you can.

### Requests for pulls
* The best course of action is to fork the main repository before you begin contributing to the project. This enables you to work on your individual copy of the codebase and submit a pull request for your modifications whenever you're ready.
* Test your modifications carefully before sending a pull request to make sure they function as intended.
* Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your neighborhood branch.

### Bug Report:
* As the possibility of bugs are quite high, whenever you find a bug while testing or by simply reading the code please use the feature that GitHub offers which is “bug report” to report any existing bug, you can find this page under the repository name, then click “issues”,  click on “new issues”, choose the type of issue you would like to open and finally click on “get started”. The bug report page is very easy to understand as everything is structured in all the important details that you need to write are explained thoroughly on the page. Using this feature will enable us to track bugs and solve them to make our project more stable.

### Considereds:
* Title: Be succinct and precise. Clearly describe the nature of the bug.
If the title is inadequate, further state where, when, and how the bug occurred.
* Visual proof: A screenshot or video might make the developer more aware of the issue.
* Expected vs. actual outcome: Be succinct and direct.
* Reproducible steps: List the actions that led to the error.
* Environment: Provide crucial details such the browser, operating system, screen resolution, and zoom level.
* Console log: Identify the issue's root cause. To help the developer find the problem more quickly, use the source URL.
* Priority and severity: The extent of the influence on your product and how promptly it should be looked into. 

> Adding useless information will make it more challenging to pinpoint the issue, so keep that in mind. Don't copy anything twice.  When you have all of this data and still want assistance, put it all together into a report and send it to 
> email it to support@studyspace.com

## User Classes and Characteristics
Three user kinds are present in our system:
1. Client Group
* Customers use our system directly to browse rooms, book them, sign up for our newsletter, and leave feedback using the provided comments and 5-star rating system. Since phone numbers, emails, and confirmation times must be entered in order to make a successful booking, that we only save a minimal amount of customer information in our system. 
2. Organizers who are aloof from the system. 
* They merely need to consider the available rooms and any new ones that will be added to their queues before preparing their services. The organizer's name, address, role, and other details are kept in the database.
3. Admin
* It is the administrator's responsibility to maintain the managerial features of the website as well as the inventory and all the rooms and organizers' information.
