# Developer Guidelines
## Coding Guidelines for Developers
### The software developers that build the system or contribute to it can benefit from the guidance provided in this on-going publication. The suggestions address:
* Documentation and coding standards 
* Links to norms of behavior 
* How tasks are finally performed and how developers communicate with consumers and one another

### Every factor we have identified here enables the technical team to work with the executive team to make choices and steer the process toward success. 
* Although there is no expectation that you will remember anything, you should read the full manual at least once if you only sometimes create code or are not a part of the StudySpace system engineers' team.
* You should read these instructions if you are a member of the StudySpace system development team.

### Developers’ Interaction
* The rules and documents of the community must be followed by all members. Developers should communicate with one another using email, Whatssapp groupchat or Microsoft Teams.

> These are not rigid regulations, but rather *guidelines*. They would, in our opinion, serve to enhance cooperation, streamline our workflow, and benefit both the "products" that we make as developers as well as ourselves personally. The StudySpace system developers would be delighted to answer any questions you may have about the contents of this document.

### Goal of the Developer Guidelines:
* These rules are meant to make everything we create better so that we can proudly claim, "I was a part of that!" We shouldn't let up too much in our efforts to adhere to these rules. If you think they are taking too long, we need to review them. These facts can be altered.

### Code Format
* There should only be one code command per line.
* A two-line margin should be used to separate each code block from its neighbors.
* Control Flow 
* Guard Clause with indents
* Simple Parameter for Enumeration

### Code Scope
* Global variables DO NOT change them they are defualt 
* classes with just default constructor values should have default constructors.
* Name classes with their main functionality 
* Methods should be stored in MethodClass
* Everything in the code, including variables, should have names that are understandable and appropriate for their purposes (NO !@$^&%) allowed ).

### Which programming language should I use?
* There are no precise requirements for the programming languages that should be used to create StudySpace software. However, keep in mind that any software you produce will need to be maintained by you and your coworkers (both present and future). However, we now use HTML, CSS,  JQuery, and Javascript , we welcome any improvements that would enhance our project.

### Code comments
* wehn starting to issue a note of a code or an update write the right parameters that will help other developers to understand your point of view and changes.

### Readability
* Try to interact on usual basis to understand what is happening
* Do not try to fit as much code as you can into as few lines.
* avoid long lines of codes (MAX: 100 CHAR PER LINE)

### Issue Tracker 
* It accepts newly reported software issues and, when it is fixed, it is labeled as complete.

### Feature requests
* We are open to suggestions for new features. Before submitting a feature proposal, please take a time to make sure your concept matches with the project's objectives and scope. It is your responsibility to persuade the project maintainers to approve the feature. Please be as specific and contextual as you can.

### Requests for pulls
* The best course of action is to fork the main repository before you begin contributing to the project. This enables you to work on your individual copy of the codebase and submit a pull request for your modifications whenever you're ready.
* Test your modifications carefully before sending a pull request to make sure they function as intended.
* Once you're satisfied with your changes, commit them to your neighborhood branch.

### Bug Report:
### Considereds:
* Title: Be succinct and precise. Clearly describe the nature of the bug.
If the title is inadequate, further state where, when, and how the bug occurred.
* Visual proof: A screenshot or video might make the developer more aware of the issue.
* Expected vs. actual outcome: Be succinct and direct.
* Reproducible steps: List the actions that led to the error.
* Environment: Provide crucial details such the browser, operating system, screen resolution, and zoom level.
* Console log: Identify the issue's root cause. To help the developer find the problem more quickly, use the source URL.
* Priority and severity: The extent of the influence on your product and how promptly it should be looked into. 

> Adding useless information will make it more challenging to pinpoint the issue, so keep that in mind. Don't copy anything twice.  When you have all of this data and still want assistance, put it all together into a report and send it to 
> email it to support@studyspace.com
