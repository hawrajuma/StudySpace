# User Classes and Personalities

Three user kinds are present in our system:
1. Client Group
Customers use our system directly to browse rooms, book them, sign up for our newsletter, and leave feedback using the provided comments and 5-star rating system. Since phone numbers, emails, and confirmation times must be entered in order to make a successful booking, that we only save a minimal amount of customer information in our system. 


2. Organizers who are aloof from the system. 
They merely need to consider the available rooms and any new ones that will be added to their queues before preparing their services. The organizer's name, address, role, and other details are kept in the database.


3. Admin
It is the administrator's responsibility to maintain the managerial features of the website as well as the inventory and all the rooms and organizers' information.
