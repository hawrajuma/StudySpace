# User Classes and Characteristics

Our system has three types of users:
1. Customer Group
Customers interact directly with our system to place orders, modify orders, receive bills, and provide feedback. We do store minimal of the customer information in our system. Customers place orders, and then the other series of events begin.

2. Chefs do not interact with the system. 
They only need to look at the dishes in their queues and prepare them accordingly. The database stores the chef's name, address, specialty, and so on.

3. Admin
The administrator's job is to manage the inventory and other menu and chef information in the system.
