# Starting from previous project 

The goal of this website is to offer the student a space where they can focus on
their studies, since studying with other people will give the impression of being
in classroom and thus, the students will feel as if they will be held accountable
if they slacked in their studies, also it can act as a social platform where
students can meet and talk about their school experience and give some of
their knowledge and expertise.

Therefore, the website will help in increasing the students school performance
due to their ability to focus and joining our study room website. The
documentation provided explains the details that interest the developers who
would like to join our project so they can decide and make a decision to invest
their time and effort in building the website.

Furthermore, the project has been done according to the attribute driven
design (ADD), which is simply a methodology that is used to produce software
architectures that priorities the quality attributes of the system. This method
will assist the development stage and make it easier.
