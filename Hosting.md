# Hosting 

> Our team opted for canned hosting as we all came with a consensus that it is the best solution; we have due to the fact that it is a newly made open-source project. The canned host website we have used is GitHub as all of the team members are quite familiar with it and have already used it in couple of projects. GitHub seems the optimal solution for us as it has a version control system, and a bug tracker and as I stated earlier the group is familiar with all these great features that could serve and achieve our goals.
