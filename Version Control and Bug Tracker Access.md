# Version Control and Bug Tracker Access
We plan to use Git for version control and GitHub for bug tracking. We will
access these systems through our GitHub repository, where we will keep track of
changes made to the codebase and maintain a record of previous versions. To
ensure best practices for version control, we will create a new branch for each
feature or bug fix, commit frequently with meaningful commit messages, and
merge changes back into the main branch once they have been reviewed and
tested. This will allow us to easily revert changes if necessary and maintain a
clean and organized codebase.
For bug tracking, we will use GitHub's built-in issue tracking system. When an
issue is reported, we will clearly describe the issue and provide steps to
reproduce it. We will then assign the issue to the appropriate team member for
resolution and prioritize it based on its severity and impact on the project. Once
the issue has been resolved, we will close the issue and include a description of
the fix.
By following these best practices, we hope to ensure the success and longevity
of our open source project. We will maintain a transparent and organized
development process, allowing our community of contributors to easily
contribute to and improve our project. We are committed to ensuring that our
project is up-to-date, relevant, and bug-free for our users.
Overall, we believe that our approach to version control and bug tracking will
help us maintain a high level of quality for our open source project. By keeping
our codebase organized and our development process transparent, we hope to
attract more contributors and provide a better experience for our users. We will
continue to refine our processes and practices over time to ensure the success
and longevity of our project.
